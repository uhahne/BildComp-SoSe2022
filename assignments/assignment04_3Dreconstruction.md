# BildComp SoSe 2022 - Assignment #04 - Create 3D geometry

## Task
Implement and run a script with Python and Open3D that computes a 3D mesh from an Azure Kinect recording. The input is only the recording as a .mkv file and the output is one 3D mesh (as .ply file). You can use all example and tutorial code snippets from the Open3D documentation.
Write a readme file that explains:
- how to get from a .mkv file to a 3D mesh,
- how to run the script
- and what the script does.
  
## Exemplary .mkv file
You can record your own .mkv file during the class on June 14th.


## Hints
You can follow http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/reconstruction_system/index.html, but you have to use the provided .mkv file.
If you have a Kinect or any other 3D camera at hand, you can use your own data.

Check out [this project](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) to get an impression about a good readme file.

## Rating
- The script extracts the needed data properly from the .mkv file. (2 points)
- The script creates a 3D model of the scene in one file. (2 points)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented. And it can be well explained in the consultation. (up to 3 points)
- Readme is well written and helpful. It contains all used modules and their version. (up to 3 points)
- BONUS: Extraordinary implementation and results. (up to 2 points)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py files) and short explanation (readme.md file) either as one zip file or as a link to a public github respository via FELIX. If you use a Github link, please create a tag of the final version before the deadline.
- Do not hand in the resulting 3D mesh (preferably as .ply) as it is too big. Please only show it during the consultation.
- The reamde file should be no longer than 600 words, it can be German or English.
- The code is written mainly on your own and any other source is mentioned in the code. If two groups hand in the same or extremely similar solution, both groups do not pass the assignment.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
